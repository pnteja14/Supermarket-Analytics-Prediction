Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing supermarket transaction data to derive meaningful insights and predict future trends. Through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we investigate key metrics such as customer spending patterns across product categories, sales distributions, and performance trends. The project utilizes statistical analysis and visualization techniques to uncover underlying relationships in the data.

Additionally, advanced predictive models are developed to forecast future sales and spending behavior, helping supermarkets make data-driven decisions. The predictions aim to identify high-demand products, optimize inventory, and enhance revenue strategies.

Key Components:
1. Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing supermarket data for analysis.
2. EDA: Visualizing and summarizing customer spending, product categories, and sales metrics.
3. Descriptive Analysis: Answering critical questions such as average spend per category and identifying high-performing products.
4. Predictive Modeling: Implementing machine learning models to forecast future trends and sales performance.
5. Insights & Recommendations: Providing actionable strategies to improve supermarket operations and customer engagement.
